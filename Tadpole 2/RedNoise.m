function M = RedNoise(ny,nx,beta,variance,periodic)

% M = RedNoise(ny,nx,beta,variance)
%
%  Generates a self-affine surface with dimensions (ny,nx) characterized by
%  the relationship
%
%  P = f^-beta
%
%  where P is spectral power and f is spatial frequency. The fractal 
%  dimension D is related to beta by
%
%  D = (7 - beta)/2
%
%  topography typically falls in the range 1.5 > beta > 2.5. The surface
%  heights are scaled such that the total variance is variance. beta = 0 
%  creates white noise; more positive values concentrate more variance at 
%  longer wavelengths. If periodic is 1, the output will be periodic at the
%  edges (works best if ny == nx).

# Tadpole
MIT landscape evolution model

Tadpole is a simple landscape evolution model that runs in MATLAB. The current version will run in 64-bit Mac OS X or Windows. To get started, copy one of the scripts from the Tadpole/examples directory into Tadpole/ and run it from there.

If you use Tadpole for work that results in a publication, please acknowledge Tadpole in the text and cite one or more of the following papers, as appropriate:

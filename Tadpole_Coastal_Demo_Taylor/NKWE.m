% no-erosion rules 

% no erosion in:
%
% 1. areas that are flooded (or local minima, if the user did not request
% to flood depressions when doing flow routing). We assume these are areas of
% temporary deposition.
%
% 2. Fixed boundaries and other locations requested by user, as recorded in the matrix C.
%
% 3. Non-channels. Note that if we use a midpoint method like RK2, we 
% should use the channel grid determined at the beginning of
% the time step, not the grid identified locally, since this call to NKWE
% could be one of the sub-steps in the RK2 method.
